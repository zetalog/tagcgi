The tagging CGI framework allows the web developers to insert special tags
into the HTML files to form HTML templates. With a tag-cgi based program
executed by the web service CGI interface, it can interpret the tags into
dynamic contents using cgi-schemas.

User inputs are passed as environments that can be referenced using tags.
Tagging CGI allows several types of user inputs, with which web developers
can present flexible contents in the pages like tables, choice boxes,
wizards, etc,. There are also logical expression tags to control the
outputs of the web page contents.

The tagging CGI has already been deployed in the real products. They all
require a very thin (low memory consumption, fast enough) interpreter to
present configuration portals to the appliance users. This demo programs
implements a small web site to demonstrate the capability of the tagging
CGI.
